      [h.harders@tu-bs.de Harald Harders]: I like the &mu; that is a mixture from the u and the p, as it is in cm-super (with serifs), more than the Latin Modern &mu; which does not have serifs at all. But this topic seems to be controversial. [stefan-ulrich.nntp@zen.co.uk Stefan Ulrich] does not agree. He thinks that most greek fonts don't have a serif at the descender of the
      <code>\textmu</code>

         Hardly implementable to full extent. Knuth constructs plusminus by shifting plus so that its bottom touches the baseline and next places a bar (minus) on the baseline. This works for circa half of the LM family. In the rest of fonts the glyph would be too high (most notably in LMBX5, LMBX6, LMSSQBX8 and LMSSQBO8). We decided that the resulting glyph should not be higher than ascender height; if it would, we decreased its height par force.

      Arni Magnusson (2004-04-16): Thanks for creating the lmodern fonts. Icelandic LaTeX users have been using cm-super to render the &THORN; (thorn) and &ETH; (eth) characters in type 1, and although cm-super does a fine job, lmodern seems like a cleaner solution to the &THORN; and &ETH; problem.
      <br>
      I understand you are still working on the fonts, and I'd like to offer my comments on issues specific to Icelandic characters. If you open the three attached PDF documents (not provided here, Jacko does have the examples), you will notice mainly three differences:
     </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
     <li>
      the upper case &THORN; should carry its belly higher in lmodern,
     </li>
     <li>
      the comma over the &uacute; should have a lower angle, and
     </li>
     <li>
      the neck of the &eth; should be bent further down.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <dl>
     <dd>
      Knuth's bitmaps and cm-super look similar to books printed in Iceland.
     </dd>
     <dd>
      The kerning is also an issue, in light of Knuth's original goal, described in the TUGboat 21(2):
      <i>
       "the rendering [should] be the same in ten years [...] on everybody's machine it [should] come out the same, not only now but in the future."
      </i>
      An ambitious goal, but at any rate, the smaller the kerning differences, the better.

      Morten H&oslash;gholm (2004-06-11): At this years BachoTeX I talked to Boguslaw about adding some more ligatures to Latin Modern, as we in Danish really need fj. At

       http://www.eur.nl/fw/staff/lokhorst/metafont.html
      </a>
      a lot of ligatures are shown, although not all of them are particular nice. He promised to look at it. (When you have the standard fi and ij ligatures, you would also think there should be an fij, right? In polish they have a common flower named &lsquo;fijolet&rsquo; making Boguslaw even more eager to add it... The Dutch use it in common words as &lsquo;fijn&rsquo; as well.) I guess this calls for a special fontencoding for Danish users. Harald Harders: There are some good ligatures. But for example the fff ligature is useless in German. You should be careful in adding new ligatures.

      Mart&iacute;n Dar&iacute;o Safe (2004-07-05): When using the lm package version 0.92, almost all occurrences of &lsquo;ij&rsquo; and &lsquo;IJ&rsquo; in your document will output ij and IJ Dutch digraphs. This seems inadequate for all European languages but Dutch. Also, this behaviour can prevent you from copying and pasting, searching, and indexing words containing &lsquo;ij&rsquo; on PDF files for non-Dutch texts. More description about that topic at

      (2004-07-17): Similar to [sS]cedilla, [tT]cedilla should really be a [tT] with cedilla below. Both, [sS]cedilla and [tT]cedilla should be used in T1/Cork encoding, as the turkish [sS]cedilla would not be available otherwise, and using [sS]cedilla and [tT]commacent at the same time would be inconsistent. [sS]commaacent and [tT]commacent are still available via the QX encoding. Also, the EC fonts, which can be seen as reference implementation of the T1/Cork encoding, use [sS]cedilla and [tT]cedilla.

      Ram&oacute;n Casares (2005-06-01): The Latin Modern fonts are really needed in Spanish, so I am following its development with much interest. One thing I have notice, comparing last year printings &ndash; from August to be more precise &ndash; with printings done with the new version, is the horizontal placement of the acute accent. In the last year printing, the acute accent was a little bit to the right, but acceptable. The current version is too much to the left. And, in the case of the &iacute;, is imposible for me not to notice it every time I read it. So I would suggest to use the Computer Modern model to place the acute accent, which is just where it should.

      Stephan Hennig (2005-03-08): In thread "Italicalized old-style figures" from 2004-09-08 on comp.text.tex there has been some agreement to the opinion CM's old-style figures do look ugly. Is it possible for LM to provide nicer old-style figures?
      <br>
      As I'm completely ignorant about font design I don't really know what makes CM's old-style figures look so boring. And I don't know if a complete redesign would be necessary to get nicer ones. Maybe just slanting the current old-style digits slightly could make the single digits look more individual and less obstrusive?

        : I think only a complete new design would help. For instance, the 1 and 3 normally really look different in lining and old-style figures which they don't for LM. Slanting is wrong in my opinion.

      Thomas Zell (2010-06-22): The hinting of the capital "W" seems to be broken for example in lmr10. Acrobat Reader paints the diagonal lines way too thick. I edited the font in FontForge and removed all of the horizontal hints which seemed oddly placed to me (leaving only one at the bottom) and the "W" looked fine. Could this be due to a bug in Metatype1?
