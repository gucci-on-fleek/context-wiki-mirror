      The font designer decides on the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; size of the font
     </span>
    </h2>
    <p>There are two parts to this:
</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <b>
       What the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; size indicates.
      </b>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>First, what the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; size indicates is the designer&rsquo;s 
_intended use size_ for the font, such that when you plan 
to use the font &ldquo;Times-Roman&rdquo; without any special rescaling, 
it should in fact be equivalent  to &ldquo;Times-Roman at &rsquo;natural size&rsquo;&rdquo;.
</p>
    <p>For most fonts, this &lsquo;natural size&rsquo; is 10&nbsp;pt, but special display
or footnote fonts may have a different intended use size, and the
font designer may have made special glyph adjustments for that purpose.
For example, the computer modern family has special fonts
with a &lsquo;natural&rsquo; size anywhere between 5&nbsp;pt and 17&nbsp;pt. 
</p>
    <p>The glyphs in the specific fonts with a smaller &lsquo;natural&rsquo; size (like 8&nbsp;pt)
are in fact a little bit bolder and wider than the same glyphs in
the font designed to be used at 10&nbsp;pt. This makes sense when you
consider that the 8&nbsp;pt font is likely be used along with the 10pt
font for e.g. footnotes. The 10&nbsp;pt font used at 8&nbsp;pt size would look
thinner and weaker than the actual font designed for 8&nbsp;pt.
</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <b>
       What the &lsquo;design&rsquo; size indicates.
      </b>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Second, a design size in points like &lsquo;10&nbsp;pt&rsquo; is somewhat misleading,
because what it actually is, is just a different way of saying &ldquo;at
the expected size for traditional main text&rdquo;. The &ldquo;10&nbsp;pt" is notf
necessarily a measure of _anything_ in the font. In fact, font designers
sometimes do not use a &ldquo;XX&nbsp;pt&rdquo; design size at all. The Minion font family
has fonts with names like "Minion Pro Caption" and "Minion Pro Display&rdquo;,
which is actually a better indication of the information the font
designer wants to convey.
</p>
    <p>That leaves the question of what the actual size is of a font used
at &ldquo;10&nbsp;pt&rdquo;. As explained above, there are no hard rules. But usually
for a modern font the &ldquo;10&nbsp;pt" is the _vertical_ space needed to enclose
all of the ascenders and descenders in the font when all the glyphs
are overlaid on top of each other. Traditionally, this was also the
with of an &lsquo;em&rsquo;, going back to the Roman era, where inscribed text fitted
characters into a square. But these days that is no longer always the
case, since some font families have condensed or extended members
(and it really only applied to &lsquo;upright&rsquo; fonts anyways).

     </span>
     <span class="mw-headline" id="If_two_fonts_have_the_same_size.2C_is_a_dimension_which_has_the_same_length_in_both._Which_one_is_this.3F">
      If two fonts have the same size, is a dimension which has the same length in both. Which one is this?
     </span>
    </h2>
    <p>No, there is no such thing. "TeX Gyre Bonum and TeX Gyre Adventor at twelve
point&rdquo; really only means this:
</p>
    <pre> "TeX Gyre Bonum at a somewhat larger size than the TeX Gyre Bonum designer
 intended and TeX Gyre Adventor at a somewhat larger size than the TeX Gyre
 Adventor designer intended."
