    <p><b>Starting point: You have installed ConTeXt, don't understand what to do with it.</b> Maybe you've seen books made with ConTeXt or you've heard that it is better for big documents than e.g. Word. Or once upon a time you tried using LaTeX because you really need to type math, but it just didn't work out. Or you wanted to do things outside of the existing LaTeX classes/templates and can't be bothered to go that far into the inner works of the system, when things are supposed to be easier in ConTeXt.
</p>
    <p>Whatever the reasons, <b>you want to learn ConTeXt, but in an easy way</b>. If it turns out that your local ConTeXt installation isn't working after all, you can do most things mentioned in [<a class="external text" href="http://live.contextgarden.net/" rel="nofollow">ConTeXt online</a>]

      Before you start

    </h3>
    <p>Before you start working your way through this ConTeXt 101 course, test your installation with the following very minimalistic document. Make sure you use only standard ASCII characters (A-Z, a-z, period, comma, dash, question mark, exclamation mark) at this point.
</p>
    <p>Open the editor you use for ConTeXting, e.g. SciTe or TextMate. Write/copy the following into a new file and save the file as hello1.tex.
