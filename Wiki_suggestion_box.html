    <p>On this page, feel free to leave suggestions to improve the wiki further.
</p>
    <p>For example, if you were looking for something and it was not obvious where to look...
</p>
    <p>It is generally a good idea to 'sign' your suggestion by using four tildes in a row. <a href="User:Taco.html" title="User:Taco">Taco</a> (<a href="User_talk:Taco.html" title="User talk:Taco">talk</a>) 18:20, 23 September 2021 (CEST)

    <ul>
     <li>
      A page on the availability of tests.zip
      <ul>
       <li>
        And how one can use it to get upto speed on ConTeXt quickly
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Add simple drawings, wherever appropriate, using tools like

       Excalidraw
      </a>
      <ul>
       <li>
        As an example, I have added one here -
        <a class="external text" href="MetaFun_-_MetaPost_in_ConTeXt.html" rel="nofollow">
         MetaPost_in_ConTeXt
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Math could be its own first-class item in the left-hand-side menu
     </li>
     <li>
      Move all the old or no-longer-relevant content to archive section
     </li>
     <li>
      Under the section of
      <a class="external text" href="Programming_in_LuaTeX.html" rel="nofollow">
       Programming_in_LuaTeX
      </a>
      some additional details that Lua is embedded inside ConTeXt & telling how to find what lua files are already shipped with distro and how to test simple lua scripts (e.g. using
      <code>mtxrun --script mytest.lua</code>
      )
     </li>
    </ul>

The mobile version of the wiki (at least as I'm seeing it here, on a not-very-old Android) is currently minimalized in such a drastic way that it seems nearly useless. In particular, most of the features that I'd use for seeing what's available on the wiki and how it's organized are not shown, making it accidentally look as if there's basically nothing here.
</p>
    <p>I don't know about wiki software; maybe this is trivial to fix. If it isn't trivial, then I suggest (for now) completely disabling the mobile version until there's time to improve it. The desktop version may not provide the ultimate convenience on a small touch screen, but at least it's visible and functioning.

It would be neat if the wiki could handle <code>\stop</code> commands more graciously (e.g., if <code>\stopX</code> could redirect to <code>\startX</code> automatically, or something), and do something plain TeX commands as well (which, AFAIK, despite their ubiquity, are simply ignored. Perhaps they could redirect to a page saying "This is a TeX command, please refer to ..." or such.).
